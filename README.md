Course project for Getting and Cleaning Data


After downloading and unzipping  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip , rename the top directory of the unzipped directory tree to "HAR" for convenience and move it to the working directory for RStudio.

Download "run_analysis.R" from this repository to the same working directory.

Open "run_analysis.R " in RStudio and "source" the file.

The following line will perform the analysis and store the data frame in the variable "xtidy".
    xtidy = run_analysis()

 See the "CodeBook.md" file in this repository for details on how the data is cleaned.
